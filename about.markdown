# Myself

Hey there!

My name is Steven Gu and I am a soon to be [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/){:target="_blank"} high school
graduate and first year computer science student at the University of Waterloo.

I enjoy a variety of academic subjects, ranging from physics to philosophy, mathematics to music. It is my belief that any subject
is enjoyable if it is taught in an engaging manner.

As for general interests and hobbies, there's far too many to explain fully, but here's some stuff that I enjoy doing:

- Playing sports. I enjoy playing any sports, although I'm better at some than others (do not observe my basketball skills). Some notable ones include
hockey (played for 8 years), baseball, soccer, and ultimate frisbee ([yes, this is a sport!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)){:target="_blank"}).

- Card games. random Chinese card games like [_sheng ji_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_ji){:target="_blank"} which I play with adults at family
gatherings, as well as more common ones like president and poker are interesting to me.

- [Japanese (Riichi) Mahjong](https://riichi.wiki/Japanese_mahjong){:target="_blank"}. Hard to learn at first but the fact that every round of the game
is totally different every time is what makes it really enjoyable. Also involves a really large learning curve regarding statistics if you are into that type of thing.

- Biking. Started out with exploring my neighbourhood, then the surrounding neighbourhoods, and then the entire Greater Toronto Area. It's an amazing way to get exercise
individually or with friends.

- Going to the gym. A great way to release extra energy and develop self-confidence. Nothing beats epic air conditioning after biking back from a workout.

- Anime. Used to despise it because of the supposed "weeb community" but honestly there are a lot of good shows out there that shouldn't be judged by
a few bad actors. Examples include [this](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50709/Lycoris_Recoil){:target="_blank"}
and [this](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock){:target="_blank"}.

That should do for a Preface.

# This Website

I made this blog/website to share my personal opinion regarding various topics in a conversational tone, with the intent of considering the deeper
philosophical nature of my day-to-day experiences. I believe inquiry and reflection regarding individuals and their
relationship to the world is needed to give meaning to past, present, and future experiences. That being said, not everything posted on this
website will be deep shit ~~(it's not that deep!!11!!1!)~~. There's nothing wrong just considering the superficial transiency of everyday life.

I hope that some of what I write will speak to you in the same way that it does for me. And if you disagree with anything said, great!
This is what someone that can't take any criticism looks like:

# Technical Details

If you are curious to how this website was designed, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}.
As a future computer science student I wanted to put some effort in understanding the nature of web development, but writing in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript
is admittedly too much of a pain for me. Jekyll allows the user to write and format text directly through [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown){:target="_blank"}, and by using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}
I am able to host the website online publicly with no charge.

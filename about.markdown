# Myself

Hey there!

My name is Steven Gu and I am a soon to be [IBDP](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/){:target="_blank"} high school
graduate and first year computer science student at the University of Waterloo.

I made this blog/website with the intention of sharing my personal opinion regarding various subjects, frequently diving into the
philosophical nature of my day-to-day experiences. As much as I love STEM, I believe inquiry and reflection regarding individuals and their
relationships to the world is needed to give meaning to past, present, and future experiences.
I hope some of what I write will speak to you in the same way that it does for me.

# This Website

If you are curious to how this website was designed, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}.
As an upcoming computer science student I wanted to put some effort in understanding the nature of web development, but writing in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript
is admittedly a pain. Jekyll allows the user to write and format text directly through markdown, and by using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}
I am able to host the website online publicly with no charge.

-need to figure out how to add images

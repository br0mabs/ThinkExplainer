Here's a throwback to ENG4U: How do paradoxical statements convey meaning?

They do because they find some common ground between two polar opposites. And I believe I've been living through these polar opposites these
past two weeks.

From a grueling 9-to-5 labour job (actually 0830 to 1630...) to vacationing in the mountains of Yellowstone, the dichotomy between different ways of living shows that breaking
the monotomy of the comfort zone is actually quite nuanced.

Sitting at home after IB exams felt quite satisfying... for probably at most a week after. I knew I needed to explore something out of my comfort zone,
but working a labour job was not high on my list. I was slightly reluctant to be "giving up" a portion of my summer for mindless work, but I've actually
learned a decent amount regarding the industry.

The first lesson would be that **low skill work is not low effort work**. Sure, anyone can follow instructions and lift boxes, but for
8 hours? I bet not everyone would be willing to do that. I would consider myself quite physically fit and I felt like I couldn't walk anymore after
3 days of work.

Additionally, blue collar workers are behind many of the things that make up your day-to-day life, and they usually get no acknowledgement. The people
that would end up using whatever I pack into those boxes, would they ever think of the work involved? Probably not. So the second lesson I've learned is that **those
that make up the backbone of our livelihoods are those that perform their work in the shadows.**

At the time of writing, I still have 2 weeks left of work. But some have been here for years. At first I had no idea how someone could last so long
in these conditions. But I think I've slowly started to figure things out. 

Many are immigrants with little background education, are middle-aged, have kids and require a stable
source of income. If given the opportunity and the finances to, I'm sure many would choose to pursue better job opportunities through education, but the cards
are simply stacked against them.

Many work the job to provide enough to send their kids to university. This is how they get through 8 hours a day, 5 days a week,
still smiling at the end of it all. The meaning of their work is so much more than its monetary value.


In this way, the last lesson I have learned is what a **privilege it is to be young** and able to pursue higher education on the path to better job opportunities and, in the future,
work at multiple companies as I progress through co-op.

Taking some time off work (after only 3 days!) to go on a vacation to Yellowstone National Park certainly provided a well-needed break.
Although I can provide no deep reflection regarding this experience, I did get to see how amazing nature can really be. Being one of the only places in the world
where one can experience natural hydrothermal activity such as geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mudpots, the best display of earth's capabilities are on show â€” natural abstractness that cannot be matched by man-made rigour.

Additionally, experiencing the different terrain and biomes while driving over from Salt Lake City contrasts sharply with the same old views I am used to seeing back in Toronto, an example of what is needed to break the monotomy of everyday life.

Many firsts have been acheived over these past two weeks, and many more are to come.
